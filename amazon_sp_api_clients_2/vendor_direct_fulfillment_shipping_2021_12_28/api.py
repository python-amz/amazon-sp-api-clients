        Returns a list of shipping labels created during the time frame that you specify. You define that time frame using the createdAfter and createdBefore parameters. You must use both of these parameters. The date range to search must not be more than 7 days.

        | Rate (requests per second) | Burst |
        | ---- | ---- |
        | 10 | 10 |

        The `x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit` response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The table above indicates the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may see higher rate and burst values then those shown here.

            created_after: Shipping labels that became available after this date and time will be included in the result. Must be in ISO-8601 date/time format.
            created_before: Shipping labels that became available before this date and time will be included in the result. Must be in ISO-8601 date/time format.
            sort_order: Sort ASC or DESC by order creation date.
            next_token: Used for pagination when there are more ship labels than the specified result size limit. The token value is returned in the previous API call.
